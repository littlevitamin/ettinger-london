However, mechanisation and especially globalisation meant that most of these factories closed in the late 1990s.<\/p><p>James Homer Ltd was one of the oldest surviving leather goods factories, established in 1890 and having always occupied the same building. When Ettinger took over the factory, production standards were raised in order to meet international luxury standards and considerable investment has been done over the years into maintaining and upgrading the factory, as well as train staff.<\/p>",
