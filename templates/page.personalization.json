These initials are expertly applied onto the leather items by hand, using antique letter sets, and the spacing of each letter is adjusted individually to ensure it is pleasing to the eye. It is this level of personalisation that makes Ettinger leather goods really stand out.<\/p><p>Embossing a finished product requires a lot of skill and experience and consists of heating some special brass blocking dies before applying onto the leather goods with blind emboss (no foil), some gold or silver foil. This is therefore done by our best craftsperson to guarantee the best results.<\/p><p>The special set of characters that we use were commissioned especially by us in a <strong>unique and highly elegant style<\/strong> and we currently can add up to 5 characters per leather item.<\/p><p>Most items will be blocked on the front bottom right-hand corner, but this may vary from item to item. Moreover, not all our products can be initialled, due to manufacturing restrictions. If the option does not appear on the product page, then this item cannot be initialled.<\/p>",
