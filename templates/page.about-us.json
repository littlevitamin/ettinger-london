Thanks to his natural ability for languages and his engaging character, he had worked in his native Germany, Italy and Switzerland, in various industries. The vagaries of history meant he had to move to London in 1933 and found employment as the UK representative for several German factories producing leather goods, jewellery and gifts. In 1934, Herion of Pforzheim – a German leather goods manufacturer – offered him the exclusive agency for the UK and he was set up with an office in Regent Street in London. He applied his talents to supplying the best department stores of the time with unique luxury gifts and leather goods and the business soon became “G Ettinger Ltd”. With Asprey’s, Harrods and Fortnum’s soon becoming regular customers, his reputation rapidly gained ground. A tireless worker and great enthusiast, he worked late into his 90s and passed over the reins of the company to his eldest son, Robert, in 1990.<\/p>",
